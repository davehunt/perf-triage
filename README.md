### send-reminder.py
Note: this script is a WIP and we're working on integrating it with the other
scripts.

The first time you run, you'll need to create a virtualenv and install the
dependencies:
```sh
# Create virtualenv
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtualenv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

See `send-reminder.py` for details on running.
